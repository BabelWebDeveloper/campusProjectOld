On the company side, the app enable to store all orders, payments and categorised goods. The app also provide a reports  which enable company to improve sales.
2. Our target group is a small companies. Such companies usually doesn't have big budget to buy large, personalised e-commerce software but thanks to simplicity of my app, the cost is not big and they can have smaller but more personalized app. If someone will want an extra functionality, it will be not hard to expand an app.
3. Main competition of my app is an Amazon and Allegro.
